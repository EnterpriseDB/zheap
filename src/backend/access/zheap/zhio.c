 * RelationGetBufferForZTuple
 *

 *	with free space >= given len.
 *
 *	This is quite similar to RelationGetBufferForTuple except for zheap
 *	specific handling.  If the last page where tuple needs to be inserted is a
 *	TPD page, we skip it and directly extend the relation.  We could instead
 *	check the previous page, but scanning relation backwards could be costly,
 *	so we avoid it for now.
