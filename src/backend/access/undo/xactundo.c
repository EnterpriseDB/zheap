 *	  management of undo record sets for transactions
 *
 * Undo records that need to be applied after a transaction or
 * subtransaction abort should be inserted using the functions defined
 * in this file; thus, every table or index access method that wants to
 * use undo for post-abort cleanup should invoke these interfaces.
 *
 * The reason for this design is that we want to pack all of the undo
 * records for a single transaction into one place, regardless of the
 * AM which generated them. That way, we can apply the undo actions
 * which pertain to that transaction in the correct order; namely,
 * backwards as compared with the order in which the records were
 * generated.
 *
 * Actually, we may use up to three undo record sets per transaction,
 * one per persistence level (permanent, unlogged, temporary). We
 * assume that it's OK to apply the undo records for each persistence
 * level independently of the others. At least insofar as undo records
 * describe page modifications to relations with a persistence level
 * matching the undo log in which undo pertaining to those modifications
 * is stored, this assumption seems safe, since the modifications
 * must necessarily touch disjoint sets of pages.
 *
 * All undo record sets of type URST_TRANSACTION are managed here;
 * the undo system supports at most one such record set per persistence
 * level per transaction.

 * refusing undo-writing transactions completely. This constant represents
 * the percentage of UndoRequestManager space that may be consumed before we

 *
 * Note that this should be set so that the remaining capacity when the limit
 * is hit is at least MaxBackends; if this is done, it shouldn't be possible
 * to hit the hard limit unless the system crashes at least once while the
