 *
 * Undo launcher is responsible for launching the workers iff there is some
 * work available in one of work queues and there are more workers available.
 * To know more about work queues, see undorequest.c.  The worker is launched
 * to handle requests for a particular database.
 *
 * Each undo worker then starts reading from one of the queues the requests
 * for that particular database.  A worker would peek into each queue for the
 * requests from a particular database, if it needs to switch a database in
 * less than undo_worker_quantum ms after starting.  Also, if there is no
 * work, it lingers for UNDO_WORKER_LINGER_MS.  This avoids restarting
 * the workers too frequently.
