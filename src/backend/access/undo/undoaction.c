 * To apply the undo actions, we collect the undo records in bulk and try to
 * process them together.  We ensure to update the transaction's progress at
 * regular intervals so that after a crash we can skip already applied undo.
 * The undo apply progress is updated in terms of the number of blocks
 * processed.  Undo apply progress value XACT_APPLY_PROGRESS_COMPLETED
 * indicates that all the undo is applied, XACT_APPLY_PROGRESS_NOT_STARTED
 * indicates that no undo action has been applied yet and any other value
 * indicates that we have applied undo partially and after crash recovery, we
 * need to start processing the undo from the same location.
