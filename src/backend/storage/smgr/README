Storage Managers
================

In the original Berkeley Postgres system, there were several storage managers,
of which only the "magnetic disk" manager remains.  (At Berkeley there were
also managers for the Sony WORM optical disk jukebox and persistent main
memory, but these were never supported in any externally released Postgres,
nor in any version of PostgreSQL.)  The "magnetic disk" manager is itself
seriously misnamed, because actually it supports any kind of device for
which the operating system provides standard filesystem operations; which
these days is pretty much everything of interest.  However, we retained the
notion of a storage manager switch and it turned out to be useful for plugging
in a new storage manager to support buffered undo logs.

In Berkeley Postgres each relation was tagged with the ID of the storage
manager to use for it.  This is gone.  While earlier PostgreSQL releases were
hard coded to use md.c unconditionally, in PostgreSQL 13 storage managers
can be defined that access other types of data files through shared buffers.

The files in this directory, and their contents, are

    smgr.c	The storage manager switch dispatch code.  The routines in
		this file call the appropriate storage manager to do storage
		accesses requested by higher-level code.  smgr.c also manages
		the file handle cache (SMgrRelation table).

    md.c	The storage manager for regular relations (tables and
		indexes).

    undo_file.c The undo log storage manager.  This supports
		buffer-pool based access to the contents of undo log
		segment files.  It supports a limited subset of the
		smgr interface: it can only read and write blocks of
		existing files.

Note that md.c in turn relies on src/backend/storage/file/fd.c.
undo_file.c also uses fd.c to read and write blocks, but it expects
src/backend/access/undo/undolog.c to manage the files holding those
blocks.


Relation Forks
==============

Since 8.4, a single smgr relation can be comprised of multiple physical
files, called relation forks. This allows storing additional metadata like
Free Space information in additional forks, which can be grown and truncated
independently of the main data file, while still treating it all as a single
physical relation in system catalogs.

It is assumed that the main fork, fork number 0 or MAIN_FORKNUM, always
exists. Fork numbers are assigned in src/include/common/relpath.h.
Functions in smgr.c and md.c take an extra fork number argument, in addition
to relfilenode and block number, to identify which relation fork you want to
access. Since most code wants to access the main fork, a shortcut version of
ReadBuffer that accesses MAIN_FORKNUM is provided in the buffer manager for
convenience.
