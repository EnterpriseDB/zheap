 * When heap_update, heap_delete, or heap_lock_tuple fail because the target
 * tuple is already outdated, they fill in this struct to provide information
 * to the caller about what happened.
 * ctid is the target's ctid link: it is the same as the target's TID if the
 * target was deleted, or the location of the replacement tuple if the target
 * was updated.
 * xmax is the outdating transaction's XID.  If the caller wants to visit the
 * replacement tuple, it must check that this matches before believing the
 * replacement is really a match.
 * cmax is the outdating command's CID, but only when the failure code is
 * HeapTupleSelfUpdated (i.e., something in the current transaction outdated
 * the tuple); otherwise cmax is zero.  (We make this restriction because
 * HeapTupleHeaderGetCmax doesn't work for tuples outdated in other
 * transactions.)
 * in_place_updated_or_locked indicates whether the tuple is updated or locked.
 * We need to re-verify the tuple even if it is just marked as locked, because
 * previously someone could have updated it in place.
